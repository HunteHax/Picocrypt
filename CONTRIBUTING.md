Thank you for your interest in contributing to Picocrypt! Before getting started though, please read through this paragraph carefully. While Picocrypt is an open-source project hosted on GitHub, the primary use of GitHub is to distribute the source code to users and package maintainers as opposed to fostering collaboration on it. While I realize that well-intentioned people are often willing to contribute their time and skill to improve projects like Picocrypt, it's important to consider the developer's perspective too. As the developer of a security-focused project like Picocrypt, I prefer to not make changes to the code unless it's absolutely necessary, since new code can often break existing code that works just fine. Also, as an open-source developer, my time and resources are limited as well, and I don't want to have people contributing code that I ultimately won't accept. As such, I express my gratitude to all potential contributors for their willingness to help, but respectfully discourage anyone from opening PRs. Thank you for your understanding!
